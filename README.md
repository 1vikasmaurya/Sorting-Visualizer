# Sorting-Visualizer
I created a sorting visualizer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to visualize different sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, and heap sort. The goal is to help users understand how these algorithms work step by step by watching the elements being sorted."
